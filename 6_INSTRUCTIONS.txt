Instructions for Running the UFC Database Application

Prerequisites:
- Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
- Ensure `pandas` and `sqlite3` libraries are installed in Python. If not, you can install them using pip:
  - Open your command line or terminal and run: `pip install pandas sqlite3`.
- Ensure you have the raw dataset files `raw_fighter_details.csv` and `raw_total_fight_data.csv`.

Step 1: Setting up the Database
- Open your terminal or command line.
- Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
- Run the script once to create the database and load the data:
  - Type `python 4_load_data.py` and press Enter.

Step 2: Using the Query Interface
- Run the script to Query Database:
  - Type `python 5_query_interface.py` and press Enter.
- You will see a menu with different options:
  Choose an option:
  1. Show top 10 fighters with the most fights
  2. Show average significant strike percentages by corner color
  3. Show top 10 fighters with the most wins
  4. Show top 10 fight types by average last round duration
  5. Exit
- Enter the number of the option you wish to select and press Enter.
  - For example, enter `1` to see the top 10 fighters with the most fights.
- After selecting an option, the results will be displayed on the screen.
- To choose another option, simply wait until the current results are displayed and then enter another number.
- To exit the application, type `5` and press Enter.

Step 3: Viewing the Database (Optional)
- If you want to view or query the database outside of the Python application, you can use a SQLite database viewer.
- Open the `ufc.db` file using your database viewer to view, query, or modify the data.

Notes:
- Ensure that the file paths in the script for the raw CSV datasets (`raw_fighter_details.csv` and `raw_total_fight_data.csv`) are correct.
- If you modify the script or the database schema, you may need to delete the existing `ufc.db` file (or equivalent) and rerun the script to regenerate the database.
